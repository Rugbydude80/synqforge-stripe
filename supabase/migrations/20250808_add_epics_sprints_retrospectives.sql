-- Migration: Add epics, sprints and retrospectives tables and extend stories
--
-- This migration introduces support for epics, sprints and retrospective
-- documents within SynqForge.  Epics represent higherâ€‘level
-- functionality and group multiple tasks (stories).  Sprints organise
-- work into timeboxed iterations, and retrospectives capture a
-- summary and lessons learned after a sprint concludes.  Tasks
-- (stories) are extended with references to their parent epic and
-- sprint.

-- Ensure UUID extension is available
